I am working toward being an successful athlete and student. I am working toward these goals by working hard and pushing myself. The values I consider most necessary for my success are never giving up, not backing down from challenges, and pushing myself to be better than the people around me. I hope to get straight As for the next three quarters. I want to be known for my work ethic.
